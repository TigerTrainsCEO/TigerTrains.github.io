  <p>Tiger Trains is a website with games and projects. We have one project which is a calculator and we have one game which is Train Clicker.</p>

  <p>This is the lore of train clicker, workers make the trains by hand, coal mines provide you with more coal as fuel for the trains, steel mines provide you with steel meaning you can make more parts, factories manafacture these parts for you, banks use interest to give you trains, coal temples sacrifice one coal for tons of it, steel temples sacrifice one steel for tons of it, wizard towers summon in trains and coal planets are mined away for their vast amounts of coal.</p>
